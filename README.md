# TTSCA_small


This respository consist of $TTSCA_{small}$. We tested this on our small-sized simulated data. <br>
The respository includes masking order 0, 1, 2 and 3.<br>
Furthermore, another result that include order 1 where the leakages are not within the same patch. 

We have also added the accidental leakage results.
We refer to our paper:
[Peek into the Black-Box: Interpretable Neural Network using SAT equations in Side-Channel Analysis]()



Note: We will update the repository soon.
