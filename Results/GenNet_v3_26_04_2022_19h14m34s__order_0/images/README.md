Results for masking order 1:
- Instead of CoL, we simply just trim $x_0, x_1, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_7, x_8$ <br>
- reminding $x_2$ and $x_6$ gives us geussing entropy $= 0$. (see Figure Guessing Entropy for disjuncts of size 2 trimed with particular literals_2.png)<br>
- Then trim further see Figure x2x6onlytrim.png<br>
- Observation: Only need one literal to retrieve the key: either $x_2$ or $x_6$. This is exactly the right literal. 
  - $x_2$ is when is at the second timestamp 
  - $x_6$ is when is at the first timestamp
